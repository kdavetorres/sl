# Signup/Login System 

## Getting Started
 Create a folder called "signup-login" and open it on your favorite text editor. Create a file named app.js. Now type npm init -y on your terminal. It'll just create a package.json file to track our packages etc.

### Server Setup
 First type this on your terminal to install these packages

 ```
 npm i express mongoose passport passport-local cookie-session
 ```

 #### Short Package Description
 - express : to create our server.
 - mongoose : to connect to our database.
 - passport : our main package for signup and login including Google and Github.
 - passport-local : module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node. By plugging into Passport, local   authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports Connect-style middleware, including Express.
